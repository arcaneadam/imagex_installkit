## ImageX's Installation Kit

This is a Drupal installation profile that is used as an installation kit to get started with immediate development. Commonly known at ImageX as the InstallKit, this installation profile uses a variety of advanced techniques and innovative thinking that is not commonly seen in the Drupal community (*yet*). For example, this installation profile breaks the Drupal community's golden rule by patching core to allow for inheritable profiles enabling a common codebase to be built and reused with any project.

## Documentation
